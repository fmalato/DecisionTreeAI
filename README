#### PROGRAM UTILIZATION: ####
##############################

1. Set the program:
   For a proper use of the program, you need to set the local path to the chosen data set.
   The program provides this function at line 15 in the "demo.py" file. Set it correctly, or it won't work.

   As a second rule, you must either place the target attribute as the rightmost attribute in your data set or
   change the targetAttr assignment in line 18, looking for the right values in your data set.

   Remember also to set the proper delimiter (line 15). Else, the program won't crash, but won't even work properly.

2. How to read the output:
   The program will print a bunch of values, arrows and names, like this one:

   density
	--->	0.99754
			alcohol
				--->	9.4
								----->	5
				--->	10
								----->	6
				--->	8.8
								----->	5

	the output has the following rules:
	- Each name stands for a node name, which stands for a specific attribute of the data set;
	- Each arrows stands for a branch, i.e. a different unique value of the attribute upon the arrow;
	- Each number stands for a unique value of the splitter attribute, which is the weight of that specific branch;
	- If there's another arrows under a number, without any label, it means that there's no need to split on another
	  attribute. In that case, every branch leads to a leaf;
	- If there are no more arrows nor labels after a number, it means that such a number is a leaf of the tree.
